Personal project: Mahjong Memo
This app records what tiles are perceived to be safe to discard and in the tile acceptance of your current Mahjong hand.
The Mahjong hand is not displayed within this application, and it doesn't hook onto your online mahjong game or scan screenshots to "know" what your current hand is.
In short, this only remembers the tiles for you and currently do nothing else (as doing too much will probably step over some arbitrary lines).

Built for Boot.dev Personal project 1.

(Work in progress)

This is my personal project for an app called "Mahjong Memo"

What it does:
- Record what tiles you perceive to be safe to discard and in the tile acceptance of your current Mahjong hand.
- Help you share your thoughts of the tile acceptance and safe tiles of a hand/match with your peers/mentors in Mahjong  studying context.

What it does not do:
- Display your current Mahjong hand.
- Hook onto your online mahjong game or scan screenshots to "know" what your current hand is. 
- Make decision for you and tell you what the tiles are.

In short, this only remembers the tiles for you and does nothing else 
(as doing too much will probably step over some arbitrary lines).
